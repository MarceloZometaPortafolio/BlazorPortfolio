<h4>Breakdown:</h4>
<br />

<h5>Front End</h5>    
<br />

The front end is composed of a Blazor WASM (Web Assembly) project published in Github pages. This is possible thanks to it being a static 
page. Since Blazor WASM generate a static HTML file, it can be read and published as a static page by Github. 

The UI is composed of 3 main tabs:

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Resume:</strong>
        <br />
        In this section, the users can find my resume inside of an iframe tag, and they can even download it if so desired. 
    </li>
</ol>

<strong>Front end</strong>
<br />
<br />

    The front end is composed of 3 pages: Home, Leaderboards, and Game. The Home page is the landing
    page. The user is able to navigate to the Leaderboard from here and from the NavBar (present in each page).

    From the Home page, the user can start a new game by filling the dialog message. The message will not
    proceed until a name has been stablished.

<br />

<br />

    After the user has entered a name, the user will be redirected to a new page labeled Game. Here, first the user will
    see a board communicating his progress and where are the checkpoints. This board will be displayed for 30 seconds. After this,
    it will fade and the user will be presented the question and possible answers to which the user will have to answer in the first
    minute. Failure to do so will result in a game over.
