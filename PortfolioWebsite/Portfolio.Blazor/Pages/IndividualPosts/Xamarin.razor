<h3>Xamarin.Forms</h3>

Xamarin.Forms is an open source cross-platform framework from Microsoft for building iOS,
Android, & Windows apps with .NET from a single shared codebase. More information at <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin/xamarin-forms">Xamarin.Forms</a>

<h5>Description of project:</h5>
This application was designed for a small business in Ephraim called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sipitsodashack/">Sip It! Soda Shack</a>.

<br />
For making this project, I used the following technologies:

<br />
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Xamarin.Forms:</strong>This framework is for developing responsive mobile applications for iOS, Android, and Windows Apps.
        This was used in this project as the basis where the entire application is built.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Prism:</strong>This .NetFramework library is responsible for dependency injection, page navigation and other powerful techniques.
        In this project, this was particularly useful for dependency injection, which made creation and use of services easy and costless.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Shell Application:</strong>This type of Xamarin.Forms application provides great features like common navigation, URI-based navigation
        scheme and an integrated search handler.

        For this application, Shell was great for creating a modern and responsive layout using tabs, and creating the wires to navigate between pages more
        freely.
    </li>
</ol>
